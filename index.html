<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>

Leveraging the foundation built in the prior workshops RoboNLP 2017, SpLU 2018, SpLU-RoboNLP 2019, and SpLU 2020, this workshop aims to realize the long-term goal of natural conversation with  machines in our homes, workplaces, hospitals, and warehouses. It also highlights the importance of spatial semantics when it comes to communicating about the physical world and grounding language in perception. Human-robot dialogue often involves developing an understanding of grounded spatial descriptions. These capabilities invariably require understanding spatial semantics that relates to the physical environments where robots are embodied. The main goal of this joint workshop is to bring in the perspectives of researchers working on physical robot systems and with human users, and align spatial language understanding representation and learning approaches, datasets, and benchmarks with the goals and constraints encountered in HRI and robotics. Such constraints include high costs of real-robot experiments, human-in-the-loop training and evaluation settings, scarcity of embodied data, as well as non-verbal communication.

  <p><b>Beyond physical robots: How to achieve joint spatial reference with a smart environment</b></p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
  Interacting with a smart environment involves joint understanding of where things and people are or where they should be. Face-to-face interaction between humans, or between humans and robots, implies clearly identifiable perspectives on the environment that can be used to establish such a joint understanding. A smart environment, in contrast, is ubiquitous and thus perspective-independent. In this talk I will review the implications of this situation in terms of the challenges for establishing joint spatial reference between humans and smart systems, and present a somewhat unconventional solution as an opportunity.

  <p><b>Core Challenges of Embodied Vision-Language Planning</b></p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
    Service dogs or police dogs work on real jobs in human environments. Are embodied AI agents intelligent enough to perform service tasks in a real, physical space? Embodied AI is generally considered as one of the ultimate AI problems that would require complex, integrated intelligence combining multiple subfields of AI including natural language understanding, visual understanding, planning, reasoning, inferencing, and prediction. While steep progresses have been witnessed in several subfields in recent years, the field of embodied AI remains extremely challenging. In this talk, we will focus on the Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) problem to understand the unique technical challenges imposed at the intersection of computer vision, natural language understanding, and planning problems. We will review several examples of the EVLP problem to discuss the current approaches, training environments, and evaluation methodologies. Through in-depth investigation of the current progress on the EVLP problem, this talk aims to assess where we are in term of making progress in EVLP and facilitate future interdisciplinary research to tackle core challenges that have not been fully addressed.

  <p><b>Language-guided policy learning for better generalization and safety</b></p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
    Recent years have seen exciting developments in autonomous agents that can understand natural language in interactive settings. As we gear up to transfer some of these advances into real-world systems (e.g physical robots, autonomous cars or virtual assistants), we encounter unique challenges that stem from these agents operating in an ever-changing, chaotic world. In this talk, I will focus on our recent efforts at addressing two of these challenges through a combination of NLP and reinforcement learning — 1) grounding novel concepts to their linguistic symbols through interaction, and 2) specification of safety constraints during policy learning. First, I will demonstrate a new benchmark of tasks we designed specifically to measure an agent's ability to ground new concepts for generalization, along with a new model for grounding entities and dynamics without any prior mapping provided. Next, I will show how we can train control policies with safety constraints specified in natural language. This will encourage more widespread use of methods for safety-aware policy learning, which otherwise require domain expertise to specify constraints. Scaling up these techniques can help bring us closer to deploying learning systems that can interact seamlessly and responsibly with humans in everyday life.  </p>

  <p><b>Socially Assistive Robotics: What it Takes to Get Personalized Embodied Systems into Homes for Support of Health, Wellness, Education, and Training
  </b></p>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
    The nexus of advances in robotics, NLU, and machine learning has created opportunities for personalized robots for the ultimate robotics frontier: the home. The current pandemic has both caused and exposed unprecedented levels of health & wellness, education, and training needs worldwide, which must increasingly be addressed in the home.   Socially assistive robotics has the potential to address those needs through personalized and affordable in-home support. This talk will discuss human-robot interaction methods for socially assistive robotics that utilize multi-modal interaction data and expressive and persuasive robot behavior to monitor, coach, and motivate users to engage in health, wellness, education  and training activities. Methods and results will be presented that include modeling, learning, and personalizing user motivation, engagement, and coaching of healthy children and adults, stroke patients, Alzheimer's patients, and children with autism spectrum disorders, in short and long-term (month+) deployments in schools, therapy centers, and homes. Research and commercial implications and pathways will be discussed. <em>Originally presented at Cornell CS Colloquium.</em> </p>
